                        <p>
                            During my internship at General Motors, I had the privilege of collaborating with the MOTA Tigers Embedded team, led by Nathaniel Hart. The principal 
                            focus of my role during my internship at General Motors revolved around the comprehensive development and deployment of a mock server. This server played 
                            a pivotal role in the testing of <a href="https://www.gm.com/commitments/path-to-autonomous">Ultracruise</a>. I was entrusted with the responsibility and 
                            autonomy to transform this project from its initial conceptual stage into a fully operational server, integral to the daily workflow of numerous Software 
                            Engineers. Due to the critical significance of the project, extensive research was conducted on my part to identify the optimal methods for the 
                            comprehensive fulfillment of all essential requirements. Furthermore, efforts were made to surpass the minimum objectives set forth. This involved engaging 
                            in productive dialogues with various teams within the organization to solicit their valuable input on enhancing server functionality. I am indebted to my 
                            fellow colleagues, with special recognition extended to Daniel Webb and Michael Debevec, for their invaluable contributions that played a pivotal role in 
                            the successful completion of my project at General Motors.

                        <p>
                            During my time at Atlas Air I had the pleasure of working along side the system architecture team led by Chris Weaver and my manager Judi Silliere. During 
                            this time while I was at the company Atlas was beginnig a big shift for their software and architecture from an 'on premises' focus to a cloud driven way
                            of working with data. Hence my responsibilities focused more on design of cloud architecture and sercure software practices to ensure that the cloud 
                            environment created would be safe for data storage and future feature implementations. I was able to apply my knowledge from my university classes to 
                            determine which design patterns would work best for efficeny and best coding practices to design the bases for the cloud architecture. At the end of the 
                            internship my design was presented to the rest of the team and other software engineers who would be using the cloud on a daily basis resulting in my design 
                            by approved and moved to production.
