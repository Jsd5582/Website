                        <p>
                            During my tenure at Atlas Air, I had the privilege of collaborating with the System Architecture team, under the leadership of Chris Weaver, and reporting 
                            to my manager, Judi Silliere. During this period, Atlas Air was undergoing a significant transformation in its software and architectural approach, transitioning 
                            from an 'on-premises' focus to a cloud-centric methodology for managing and utilizing data. Consequently, my responsibilities centered on the design of cloud 
                            architecture and the implementation of secure software practices to ensure the integrity and safety of data storage and facilitate future feature integration. I 
                            leveraged the knowledge I had acquired during my university studies to determine the most efficient design patterns and best coding practices for establishing the 
                            foundation of the cloud architecture. At the conclusion of my internship, my design was presented to the broader team and the software engineers who would be working 
                            with the cloud on a daily basis. Subsequently, my design was approved and transitioned into production.

                        <p>
                            During my internship at General Motors, I had the privilege of collaborating with the MOTA Tigers Embedded team, led by Nathaniel Hart. The principal 
                            focus of my role during my internship at General Motors revolved around the comprehensive development and deployment of a mock server. This server played 
                            a pivotal role in the testing of <a href="https://www.gm.com/commitments/path-to-autonomous">Ultracruise</a>. I was entrusted with the responsibility and 
                            autonomy to transform this project from its initial conceptual stage into a fully operational server, integral to the daily workflow of numerous Software 
                            Engineers. Due to the critical significance of the project, extensive research was conducted on my part to identify the optimal methods for the 
                            comprehensive fulfillment of all essential requirements. Furthermore, efforts were made to surpass the minimum objectives set forth. This involved engaging 
                            in productive dialogues with various teams within the organization to solicit their valuable input on enhancing server functionality. I am indebted to my 
                            fellow colleagues, with special recognition extended to Daniel Webb and Michael Debevec, for their invaluable contributions that played a pivotal role in 
                            the successful completion of my project at General Motors.
