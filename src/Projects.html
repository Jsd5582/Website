                                This project employs Python, the Spotify API, and various Python libraries to develop 
                                an alarm clock application capable of utilizing MP3 files as the audio source for alarm 
                                activation. The inspiration for this project arose from a personal experience when I was 
                                awakened by a jarring alarm sound, compounded by the inconvenience of having to purchase 
                                songs for $5 each. The objective of this application is to address this issue by enabling 
                                users to wake up to their preferred songs, enhancing their morning experience.

                                efficiently import, organize, and manipulate user's comic collections. Leveraging a database 
                                or .csv file, users can seamlessly add, delete, and edit comic entries, ensuring a dynamic and 
                                personalized collection. The system offers a robust search functionality, allowing users to 
                                quickly locate specific comics within their database. Additionally, users can export their entire 
                                collection in various formats such as .XML, .json, and .csv files, ensuring data portability. This 
                                project not only simplifies the management of comic collections but also enhances user experience by 
                                providing versatile tools for organization and data manipulation. Whether users are avid collectors 
                                or occasional enthusiasts, this Java-based system offers a user-friendly interface and powerful features 
                                to streamline the management of their comic book treasures.

                                This was my main project during my internship at General Motors in 2023, giving me 
                                my first ever primary developer role in a company. I was able to take this project
                                from its very first stage of a napkin drawing to delploying it on General Motors cloud
                                to be used my multiple software engineers on a daily basis. This servers' primary purpose
                                is to serve as a test site for the next generation of autonomous driving offered by GM known 
                                as Ultracruise. I was able to develop this server by using complex application of Python, 
                                Database development, and other full-stack engineering principles. As the project was being 
                                developed the scope of the project continued to grow with it, what started off as a terminal
                                based respose turned into an environment to test out new features for upcoming vehichles that 
                                uptill that point were just ideas with no basis of being implementation. At the end of the project
                                not only did my software engineering skills grow but so did my ambitions for what I wanted to do 
                                with my career.
