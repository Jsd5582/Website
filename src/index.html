        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Jaime Sebastian Diaz Jr, a senior software engineering student at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I've honed my programming skills, 
          with a focus on Python and SQL, during my academic journey at RIT and through my internship at General Motors. I've also expanded beyond coding 
          to delve into system design, user requirements, and design patterns.

          My experience has broadened my perspective on software engineering's potential, reinforcing my passion for the field. I've acquired a diverse 
          range of skills, including Python, HTML, Java, and database development, while working with tools like PostgreSQL, Django, Flask, Git, Docker, 
          VS Code, and Jenkins.

          I've excelled as a full-stack and backend developer, finding innovative solutions to unique project challenges. I'm dedicated to exploring novel 
          applications of these tools, always eager to grow.
