        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Jaime Sebastian Diaz Jr, a senior software engineering student at the esteemed <a href="education.html">Rochester Institute of Techonolgy</a> (RIT). My recent 
          professional experience includes an internship at <a href="experience.html">General Motors</a>, where I actively contributed to software engineering projects. 
          Throughout my academic journey at RIT and my internship engagements, I have meticulously refined my programming skills, particularly in 
          Python and SQL. However, I have also dedicated time to broaden my skill set beyond programming, enhancing my versatility as a software 
          engineer.

          I've been exposed to multifaceted aspects of software engineering, extending well beyond mere coding. This includes system design, 
          eliciting user requirements from the target audience, and implementing design patterns to craft efficient systems. These experiences have 
          expanded my perspective on the vast possibilities within software engineering and reinforced my passion for the field.

          I firmly believe that software possesses the transformative power to enhance human lives across various domains. I've had 
          the privilege of acquiring a diverse range of skills and hands-on experience, including Python, HTML, Java, and database 
          development. My exposure to tools and frameworks such as PostgreSQL, Django, Flask, Git, Docker, VS Code, and Jenkins has 
          significantly enriched my technical prowess.

          Leveraging this skill set, I have excelled as a full-stack and backend developer, successfully applying these competencies 
          in diverse projects with unique goals. These projects have presented numerous challenges, prompting me to research innovative 
          ways to adapt technologies to specific requirements. My dedication to exploring novel applications of these tools continues 
          to drive my growth as a software engineer.
